A deliverable created during my role as a teaching assistant (TA) of the full-time Data Science Diploma Program at BrainStation, in collaboration with my fellow TA, Sophie Johns.

Below is the description of the deliverable:

<b><u>Statistics and Politics - Deliverable 2</b></u>

<u>Introduction</u>

Now that we've gone through the process of cleaning our data and preparing it for analysis, we can begin the analysis process. See below for the key questions you'll be answering as part of this assignment.

<u>Analysis Part 2</u>

In this part we will perform some statistical analysis on the data.

1. Which data columns are correlated with the Republican vote share? Which columns are not? Does this pattern appear in all 3 elections we have data for?

2. How are the racial demographics correlated with Republican vote share? Is there any race which is consistently correlated with the Republican vote share? Are these correlations statistically significant?

3. Create 2 new dataframes: one containing only counties in California, the other containing only counties in Texas. Do the nationwide patterns that you found in the previous question still hold in these particular states? Which races remain positively (or negatively) correlated with a political party in each state? Are there races in California or Texas that have different correlations than the national trends?

<u>Analysis Part 3</u>

In this part we will perform some more advanced statistical analysis on the data.

1. At a county level visualize the percentage share of the Republican votes in each election. What visualization method is most appropriate for this task? (We are asking for three plots, one for each election.) What are some of the similarities and differences between the 3 elections?

2. Repeat this exercise but now aggregate the data at a state level. (So instead of finding the vote share of a party within a county, find the vote share of a party within a state. Note: You might need to re-calculate the relative vote share for a state to take into account the different populations of each county.) Has your answer changed about the similarity of the 3 elections?

3. Look back at the non-aggregated county-level data. Conduct one or more statistical tests to see whether the mean Republican party vote share across all of the counties are different for the 3 elections (Which statistical test is appropriate here? Assume that the people who voted in each county are a representative sample of its population.) Describe why youâ€™ve chosen your tests and interpret your results.
